# Calculator
This is just a basic calculator

This is the first project I have built on github. This is a Java application which built with JavaFX library.
It has basic functions built in the calculator. Even though there are still features missing from the calculator, the features that I specificly code were just to challenge myself. I also used SceneBuilder to create the layout of the calculator and made the styling using CSS (or -FX-CSS- I don't really know :/ ).
I might or might not add more features to this calculator so I'm open for any requested features, critic reviews on where I did wrong or can improve or anything that might help alot. I'm still a beginner programmer so do not expect alot.
